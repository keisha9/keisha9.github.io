        <h3>The First Laugh</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            As a three year old girl, all I wanted was a little sister - someone I could play with or talk to at any time of the day. 
            In May of 2008, that wish came true. That day, I was the happiest older sister in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            I still remember that I had a fever the night before she was born, and I prayed so very hard 
            that I would get better soon enough to greet my baby sister when she was brought into this world. And I did!
            I'm fairly certain that the only reason I was even allowed to wait in the hospital was that my parents
            are doctors. The moment she was clean and all wrapped up, we were escorted into the room my mother was in. Bursting with excitement, 
            I rushed towards my mother who lay on the blue bed, looking pale and tired. But she was not looking at me. Her eyes were 
            fixed on a tiny lbundle in her hands. She motioned for me to come closer to see the little baby. There she was! Red-faced and so, so 
            small, with her huge brown eyes staring right into mine. I sat on the bed next to my mother and touched my sister's hand. 
            It was barely half the size of my own! I knew, in that moment, that I was going to love her and care for her for as long as I lived.
        </p>
        <p>
            Words cannot express the joy and wonder that I had felt that day, and the immense love that I still have for her. 
            Some of my best memories I have shared with my sister, Anaya. However, the most memorable one took place only a few days after she was 
            born.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again, I was to turn four years old that year. And I was not the brightest child at the time. 
            So, one morning, I was lying on the bed next to my sister, admiring her tiny hands and feet, when my mother walked in. She was on a phone 
            call with someone from the hospital and she said something about a child born with a congenitally damaged heart. I assumed she was referring 
            to Anaya and thought that she had a missing left side of the heart. So, I made up a song about how sorry I was that she had a damaged heart 
            and sang it to her (in Marathi). <br> That was the first time she laughed.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a soft, tinkling, clear laugh, the purest thing I had ever seen. Her face crinkled up and her gums were showing. All of a sudden, 
            everything around me vanished and all I could see or hear was the small human being laughing in front of me, with her arms stretched out 
            in front of her. I touched her hand and smiled, and she wrapped her fingers tightly around one of mine. It was the most beautiful feeling 
            in this world and I will remember it till the end of my days.
        </p>
        <p>
            From that day on, we forged a bond between us so strong, that the worst possible adversity could not break it. The memories that I have shared 
            with her I will cherish forever, because they are some of the best memories I have ever made. We fight sometimes, all the time actually, but 
            at the end of the day, we truly love each other and there is no one I love more than her.
        </p>
