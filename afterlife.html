        <h3>Afterlife</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            We build our legacies in scribbled poems and painted walls
            <br>
            In quirks that stick around long after we're gone
            <br>
            In the stains on our clothes, in the things that we owned
            <br>
            In the words that we said, in the hearts that we touched
            <br>
            Our souls live on, forevermore.
        </p>
